# GitWEd - Git-based website editor

Provides a git-backed WYSIWG website editing experience.

## What does it do?

GitWEd is a application running in node.js in the cloud, which serves websites
from a git repo of your choosing. The website developer can update the HTML/CSS/image/... files
in this repo as usual. Content editors can authorize using their email
address, and then update the specially marked fragments of HTML
using [ContentTools](http://getcontenttools.com/), a WYSIWG editor.
The changes are saved to the git repo.

See https://dwbe.org/manual/ for user manual.

## How does it work?

GitWEd is written in TypeScript, compiled down to JavaScript and running on the
server using node.js and on the client in the browser. GitWEd serves plain
files from a git repo (called data repo, as it doesn't have GitWEd sources,
just the websites to be served).  The server also handles AJAX POST requests
from authorized users, which update the HTML and check in the new version into
the data repo. These POSTs update specifically marked fragments of HTML
(ones with `edit=...` attribute).

Resource files (images, JavaScript, CSS, etc.) are served exactly as is.  HTML files
are parsed, and the server expands a few additional tags, things like
`<include src="_footer.html">`; it isn't necessary to use these additional tags,
so you can just write plain HTML if you feel like it.
Additionally, references to resources in the HTML files are optionally
rewritten to use browser-cachable URLs on a CDN.

## Running locally

* checkout https://github.com/mmoskal/gitwed-sample
  (or https://gitlab.dwbn.org/mmoskal/gitwed-data if you have access)
* go there and run
```
npm install
npm start
```
* this will run a server on http://localhost:3000, serving the current directory
* if you modify files via web interface, they will be modified in the current directory
* if you modify files in the current directory, the changes should be visible at http://localhost:3000
* there is no need to worry about user accounts unless you add `jwtSecret` 
  to `config.json` - everyone connecting will be treated as an admin
* in fact, there is no need to worry about `config.json` at all

## CDN rewriting

GitWEd will generally try to rewrite your URLs so that they can be served from a CDN
(Content Delivery Network). It always rewrites the following:

* `<img src="...">`
* `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<track>`
* various `<meta ...>` and `<link ...>` tags that point to images

In the following tags, it will also rewrite links to files that are images,
or live in `cdn` sub-directory of your page, or in `/common` directory.

* `<script src="...">`
* `<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">`
* `@import` in inline CSS
* `url()` in inline CSS

Note that rewriting occurs **only in HTML**. GitWED does not rewrite your CSS or JS
files.

In general, it's good to put files in `cdn` subdirectory, as it greatly speeds up
page load. However, you cannot put there CSS files that have embedded relative `url()`
or `@import`. You can always consider lifting CSS rules with relative URLs into
an inline CSS where there will be rewritten.

You will most likely want to test this feature before deploying. To do so, make sure
all your files are checked in (but not necessarily pushed) in `gitwed-data` and
then run `make cdn`. The URLs will be rewritten to paths like
`/cdn/img_3834.jpg-2c66e904cab0c00d52a924214880179da395f587.jpg`.
When deployed, it will be something like:
`https://mycdn.somewhere.net/img_3834.jpg-2c66e904cab0c00d52a924214880179da395f587.jpg`.


## Macro language

```html
<include src="header.html">
  <div id="foobar"> ... </div>
  <group id="blah"> Something </group>
</include>
```

### New tags

* `<include>` - include a file. Content of the tag indicates what to replace - matching is done by ID;
  you can also have `<include src="..." />` if you don't want to replace anything
* `<group>` - all group tags are replaced with their content (they are invisible wrappers)
* `<if-edit>` - the tag, along with its children, is removed unless the user has edit permission

### Marking elements for editing

You need to add `edit` attribute. You will also need a unique (in file) identifier
for the element. This can be specified with `id` or as argument to `edit`. Example:

```html
<div class='foobar' edit=desc1>
<p> ... </p>
</div>

<div class='barbaz' edit id=desc2>
<h1> ... </h1>
<p> ... </p>
</div>

<li><a href="qux" class="..." edit="link-qux">Some text</a></li>
```

In the tag marked with `edit` has at least one of the following as children:
`p, ul, ol, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6` the full HTML editor will be used.
If it doesn't, only the text can be edited.

## Admin manual

This section is only relevant if you want to run your own Gitwed server.

You can invite new users from the "..." menu. The invitation is only valid for one subdirectory.
If you want the user to have write access everywhere, make them an admin.

You can always append `&redirect=/foo/bar` to an authentication link.

Users are stored in `private/users.json` file.

Example config (remove ``// comments` when you create your own):

```javascript
{
    // this is used as signing key for cookies - just generate a long "password" here
    "jwtSecret": "<generate a ~30 character random string here>",
    // this you can get from mailgun dashboard
    "mailgunApiKey": "key-0123456789...abcdef",
    // in both cases (mailgun and sendgrid) default email sender is set to `no-reply@config.mailgunDomain`
    "mailgunDomain": "mg.example.com",
    // this is your sendGrid Api KEY - you can get one from https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/
    // Gitwed uses sendgrid `only` if no mailgunApiKey was provided
    "sendgridApiKey": "SG.XXXXX-...abcdf"
    // list of email recipients that gitwed is allowed to send emails to on `/api/send-email`
    "allowedEmailRecipients" : ["me@example.com"],
    // if you want to generate map images in events, you need a key for Google Maps
    "gmapsKey": "ABcDe...FgHg",
    // this is used in subject line of emails
    "serviceName": "DWB-Edit",
    // default redirect path
    "rootDirectory": "sample",
    // pages available as directories including default
    "pages": ["sample"],
    // you can set that option to 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0, the default value is localhost
    "networkInterface": "localhost",
    // one of your domains; authentication is always handled through that one
    "authDomain": "https://example.com",
    // if set to true, we will ask Let's Encrypt for certs; only set to true if your all the domains
    // are set to your local IP, otherwise Let's Encrypt will fail and they might throttle you
    "production": true,
    // email to use for Let's Encrypt
    "certEmail": "me@example.com",
    // if set to true, it will listen on ${config.localhost}:3000 and listen to proxy requests from nginx or apache
    // otherwise, run standalone
    "proxy": false,
    // this CDN endpoint needs to be set to mirror /cdn path on the server; this will usually be either
    // "https://cdn.example.com" or "https://cdn.example.com/cdn", depending how you set it up
    // set to "/cdn" if you don't have a separate CDN
    "cdnPath": "https://cdn.example.com",
    // relative path to the main content repo
    "repoPath": "../gitwed-data",
    // relative path to additional content repos; the format is "short-key": "path"
    // the short-key will be used in URLs
    "sideRepos": {
      "home": "../gitwed-homepage",
      "foo": "../../other/foo-bar"
    },
    // relative path to repo hosting data about events
    "eventsRepoPath": "../gitwed-events",
    // virtual hosts; Let's Encrypt will be asked for certs of all of these and the authDomain
    // the format is: "virtual.host.name": "directory"
    // the directory can be in main or any of the side repos
    "vhosts": {
       "course.example.com": "course2018",
       // you may want to set directory name and host name the same, but it's not required
       "something.foobar.net": "something.foobar.net",
       // an empty directory means "/"; used to force certificate generation for that host 
       "hosting.example.com": ""
    }
}
```
